                         <p>Hi! My name is Anahita! Friends and family call me Ana! I thought I couldn't code, for a long time, that coding isn't for me! 
                              Even though I was fairly good at math in High school, I was scared of coding for some reason, thought that I'm just not built for this ...
                              But I was tired of my fear, and I wanted to prove myself wrong. It didn't happen in a day or two ... Even after I switched majors to CS, and I took CS-related courses in college, 
                              and I was admitted for UCI's CS Master's!! I still doubted myself...I took one step after another, and reminded myself along the way, that I should at least try before just deciding that I cannot do this! 
                              And, I did it! After each accomplishment I got a little more confident ... All the good things were on the other side of fear, other side of doubt! 
                              Going to UC Irvine for my CS Masters was a dream coming true for me! Even half-way into my Masters, I still didn't believe I could do it ... with every Algorithms or DS assignment completetion on my own, I 
                              gained a bit more confidence. While doing group projects with folks coming from an undergrad CS Background, I realized that I'm not far behind, 
                              that I'm even more open to accepting new challenges, embracing the unknowns, new languages, technologies, you name it! Maybe because everthing was new to me?
                              Or, becuse I was in it with the learning mindset? Whatever it was, I decided to keep this mindset, because I relaized it's helping with my growth, embracing the unkowns, being open to learning new things.
                              I got my first Software Development job, at Expedia Group, imposter syndrome kicked in for a bit in the beginning, coupled with having the worst
                              concentration of my lifetime due to the ongoing situtation in my homeland at the time (that's another story!) - the situation got out of control for a while ...
                              But, I didn't go through all that for nothing, right? I reminded myself how badly I wanted this, and got back up! Keeping a can-do attitude, I kept on
                              taking up challenging tasks, and I'd say the most valuable lesson I learned during my time there, was to ask for help when absolutely stuck, but to believe 
                              in my abilities at the same time, knowing that I was there for a reason. I was able unblock myself for the most part, only if I just put 
                              in the time and effort, and believed that I, myself, can handle this ... And, that belief part, can do magics belive it or not!!
                              <br>
                              I come from a non-traditional CS background as I have transitioned from Architecture into tech. I love learning, and creating, 
                              and that's why coding sparks joy in me! So, about 2 years ago, I decided to take my learning to the next level by going to graduate 
                              school for Computer Science. It was challenging! Especially because almost all my peers were coming from CS undergrad, and some
                              with years of experience in the tech industry! And at first, I started comparing myself to them (what a terrible mistake!)
                              But, I didn't want to give up! And, you guessed it, I didn't! <br>
                              Long story short, the outcome was that I learned how to learn effectively and efficiently! And indeed, it was 
                              the most valuable skill that I gained during graduate school.</p>
